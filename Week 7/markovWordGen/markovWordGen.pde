String trainingText = "Playing cards first entered Europe in the late 14th century, most likely from Mamluk Egypt, with suits of Batons or Polo sticks (commonly known as Wands by those practicing occult or divinatory tarot), Coins (commonly known as disks, or pentacles in occult or divinatory tarot), Swords, and Cups. These suits were very similar to modern tarot divination decks and are still used in traditional Italian, Spanish and Portuguese playing card decks. The first documented tarot packs were recorded between 1440 and 1450 in Milan, Ferrara, Florence and Bologna when additional trump cards with allegorical illustrations were added to the common four-suit pack. These new decks were called carte da trionfi, triumph cards, and the additional cards known simply as trionfi, which became trumps in English. The earliest documentation of trionfi is found in a written statement in the court records of Florence, in 1440, regarding the transfer of two decks to Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. The oldest surviving tarot cards are the 15 or so Visconti-Sforza tarot decks painted in the mid-15th century for the rulers of the Duchy of Milan. A lost tarot-like pack was commissioned by Duke Filippo Maria Visconti and described by Martiano da Tortona probably between 1418 and 1425, since the painter he mentions, Michelino da Besozzo, returned to Milan in 1418, while Martiano himself died in 1425. He described a 64-card deck with 16 cards having images of the Greek gods and suits depicting four kinds of birds. The 16 cards were regarded as trumps since in 1449 Jacopo Antonio Marcello recalled that the now deceased duke had invented a novum quoddam et exquisitum triumphorum genus, or a new and exquisite kind of triumphs. Other early decks that also showcased classical motifs include the Sola-Busca and Boiardo-Viti decks of the 1490s. In Florence, an expanded deck called Minchiate was used. This deck of 97 cards includes astrological symbols and the four elements, as well as traditional tarot motifs. Although a Dominican preacher inveighed against the evil inherent in cards (chiefly owing to their use in gambling) in a sermon in the 15th century, no routine condemnations of tarot were found during its early history. Because the earliest tarot cards were hand-painted, the number of the decks produced is thought to have been small. It was only after the invention of the printing press that mass production of cards became possible. The expansion of tarot outside of Italy, first to France and Switzerland, occurred during the Italian Wars. The most important tarot pattern used in these two countries was the Tarot of Marseilles of Milanese origin.";//Discover a new kind of university in New York City, one where scholars, artists, and designers come together to challenge convention and create positive change.

String edText = "Mithraistic texts, since Ahura-Mazda or the Divinity of Light is the second son of Zurvan (the timeless Aeon), he does not know the secret of genesis and creation. Therefore, it is Angra-Mainyu (Ahriman or — as oversimplified by Judeo-Christianity — Satan) who possesses the secret of creation as the first son of Zurvan. Deava-mahmi, one of Ahriman's disciples, steals the code of creation from Ahriman and meets Ahura-Mazda, offering him the secret of Creation which is ironically based on the knowledge and prudence of Ahriman. The Mahmi demon has been addressed as nwsites (meseetes) or the one who does not play the role of balancing or stabilization (squaring) but instead that which in Pahlavi language is called miatjig* The subject form of the ancient Persian word mayanjigih, mianjig means in-between, the double-dealer — the intermediate Mithra who betrays both sides in favor of an obscure mission. As Parsani writes in one of his eariy essays on middle-eastern sorcery, ‘Betrayal and cessation from all kinds of vision is at the heart of middle-eastern sorcery and politics. Here, the obscurity of the betrayal's purpose is more dreadful than its perversion. The double-numbering mechanism of such betrayal has also been a source of inspiration for the configuration of the Middle East's political formations and state-nomad warmachines. Nevertheless, such betrayals are es­ sentially subjected to an ominous dispersion, diffusing everywhere from mono­ theistic Beliefs to forbidden doctrines. In fact, nothing can survive the onrush of growing heresies once such betrayals become inseparable from everyday life. The Grand Betrayal or Mithro-Druj is an all-inciusive invitation, a capital YES to everyone and everything, an ultimate welcome to all and everything; for this reason it secures a diffusive and affirmative epidemic power against which religion in general has no protective structure or immuno-agent. In another page of the same essay, Parsani continues: ‘The clandestine and manipulative functions of radical betrayal manifests itself in the double- numbering configuration of Tnson or the tri-dotted perversion. Trison appears as the leering head of the Cross of Akht which is obsessed with the triangle. One cannot forget the sinister direction of this panorama: the Cross of Akht is also the demonogram of palaeopetrology and its operational polytics. Trison simultaneously feeds on unfathomably ancient abomination-machines, labyrinths of perversion and concrete pragmatics of ultimate insurgency and subversion welting up from the established grounds of religious regimes.' A glance at the royal seals and coins of pre-lslamic Persian dynasties, whose obsession with following all the purificatory procedures of monotheism and Aryanistic quintessence was unparalleled, reveals that such heresies encroached upon even the highest ranks of mages and religious foundations (See Fig. 7). A number of seals and coins bear the forbidden emblem of three dots (drvm) or Trison on one side and a boar on the other side. Note that the boar is a sacrificial animal for Ahriman or Angra-Mainyu (destructive spirit). Other seals, however, have the religiously corrected version of three dots — the order of four dots, the squaring process of perfectionism or Farrah, Swastika, the Wheel of ";
String Isaya1 = "Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth! For the Lord has spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, And they have rebelled against Me; The ox knows its owner And the donkey its master's crib; But Israel does not know, My people do not consider.  Alas, sinful nation, A people laden with iniquity, A brood of evildoers, Children who are corrupters! They have forsaken the Lord, They have provoked to anger The Holy One of Israel, They have turned away backward.  Why should you be stricken again? You will revolt more and more. The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faints. From the sole of the foot even to the head, There is no soundness in it, But wounds and bruises and putrefying sores; They have not been closed or bound up, Or soothed with ointment.  Your country is desolate, Your cities are burned with fire; Strangers devour your land in your presence; And it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers. So the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, As a hut in a garden of cucumbers, As a besieged city. Unless the Lord of hosts Had left to us a very small remnant, We would have become like Sodom, We would have been made like Gomorrah.  Hear the word of the Lord, You rulers of Sodom; Give ear to the law of our God, You people of Gomorrah: “To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to Me? Says the Lord. “I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams And the fat of fed cattle. I do not delight in the blood of bulls, Or of lambs or goats.  “When you come to appear before Me, Who has required this from your hand, To trample My courts? Bring no more futile sacrifices; Incense is an abomination to Me. The New Moons, the Sabbaths, and the calling of assemblies— I cannot endure iniquity and the sacred meeting. Your New Moons and your appointed feasts My soul hates; They are a trouble to Me, I am weary of bearing them. When you spread out your hands, I will hide My eyes from you; Even though you make many prayers, I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood.  “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; Put away the evil of your doings from before My eyes. Cease to do evil, Learn to do good; Seek justice, Rebuke the oppressor; Defend the fatherless, Plead for the widow.  “Come now, and let us reason together, Says the Lord, “Though your sins are like scarlet, They shall be as white as snow; Though they are red like crimson, They shall be as wool. If you are willing and obedient, You shall eat the good of the land; But if you refuse and rebel, You shall be devoured by the sword”; For the mouth of the Lord has spoken.  How the faithful city has become a harlot! It was full of justice; Righteousness lodged in it, But now murderers. Your silver has become dross, Your wine mixed with water. Your princes are rebellious, And companions of thieves; Everyone loves bribes, And follows after rewards. They do not defend the fatherless, Nor does the cause of the widow come before them.  Therefore the Lord says, The Lord of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, “Ah, I will rid Myself of My adversaries, And take vengeance on My enemies. I will turn My hand against you, And thoroughly purge away your dross, And take away all your alloy. I will restore your judges as at the first, And your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city.  Zion shall be redeemed with justice, And her penitents with righteousness. The destruction of transgressors and of sinners shall be together, And those who forsake the Lord shall be consumed. For they shall be ashamed of the terebinth trees Which you have desired; And you shall be embarrassed because of the gardens Which you have chosen. For you shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fades, And as a garden that has no water. The strong shall be as tinder, And the work of it as a spark; Both will burn together, And no one shall quench them.";
